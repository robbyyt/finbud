# The components folder

This folder is organised into sub-directories as follows:

- `layout` - to export all components related to the page layout. (Ex.: `Navbar`, `Footer`)
- `ui` - to export all re-usable ui components. (buttons, cards, etc..)
- `form` - to export all components related to forms. (separate from ui as forms tend to require separate attention)
- `page/feature-name` - to export all components related to a specific page / feature. (Ex.: `stock-details`, `stock-listing`)
